# BeskarOS Kernel

BeskarOS is a basic kernel for the x86-64 architecture.

## Architecture

The kernel is a monolithic x86-64 kernel written in pure Rust (with the exception of a single x86 ASM file for bootstrapping APs).
I am not planning on writing a kernel close to Linux, as I am focusing on learning the basics of x86.
