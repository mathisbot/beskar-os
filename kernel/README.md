# BeskarOS Kernel

BeskarOS is a basic kernel for the x86_64 architecture.

## Architecture

The kernel is a monolithic x86_64 kernel written in pure Rust (with the exception of a single x86 ASM file for bootstrapping APs).
I am not planning on writing a Linux-like kernel, as I am mainly focusing on learning the basics.
