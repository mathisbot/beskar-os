# Beskar HAL

This crate contains architecture-specific code for the Beskar Operating System's Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).

## Overview

The Beskar HAL provides a hardware abstraction layer that enables the Beskar OS to interact with various hardware architectures through a consistent interface. It abstracts away the details of specific hardware platforms, allowing higher-level components to function across different architectures.

## Supported Architectures

- x86_64
